This project focuses on predicting stroke risk using machine learning techniques. We have cleaned and preprocessed the data, performed feature engineering, applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression models, and optimized the model for better accuracy. Additionally, we have deployed the model on a Flask web app for easy accessibility.

## Project Overview

Stroke prediction is a critical healthcare task. This project aims to predict stroke risk by leveraging machine learning techniques. We have taken the following steps to achieve this:

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

To ensure the quality of the data, we performed the following data cleaning and preprocessing steps:

- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical features.
- Normalizing numerical features.
- Dealing with outliers.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is crucial for building effective predictive models. We created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.

## Model Building and Optimization

We experimented with two machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression. We trained and fine-tuned these models to achieve the best possible accuracy for stroke prediction.

## Flask Web App Deployment

We have deployed the best-performing model on a Flask web app for user-friendly access. The web app provides an intuitive interface for users to input their information and get a stroke risk prediction.

## Usage

To use the Flask web app for stroke prediction, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.


4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

5. Input the necessary information, and the app will provide a stroke risk prediction.
